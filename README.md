Details about the project, what did you do, how did you do  and any other relevant info that would be necessary for evaluators to judge your work

This project was created as a part of INSAID capstone to help HR Advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the org. the data was sourced from HRMS where the details of all the past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years.

In the project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
